## Introduction

This project aims to analyze sales data to derive insights about product performance, regional sales trends, month-over-month growth, and more. The data is stored in the df_orders table of the SQL Server database, and various SQL queries were executed to perform the analysis.

## Objectives

1. Identify the top 10 highest revenue-generating products.
2. Determine the top 5 highest-selling products in each region.
3. Compare month-over-month sales growth for the years 2022 and 2023.
4. Identify the month with the highest sales for each product category.
5. Determine the sub-category with the highest growth in profit in 2023 compared to 2022.

--`SQLQuery123.sql`: sql files which you can download and execute all the queries.

--`data.csv`: Data file which we have downloaded it from kaggle. However, we are going to download the dataset with the help of kaggle API.
