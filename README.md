# sql-python-project

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze sales data to derive insights about product performance, regional sales trends, month-over-month growth, and more. The data is stored in the df_orders table of the SQL Server database, and various SQL queries were executed to perform the analysis.

## Objectives

1. Identify the top 10 highest revenue-generating products.
2. Determine the top 5 highest-selling products in each region.
3. Compare month-over-month sales growth for the years 2022 and 2023.
4. Identify the month with the highest sales for each product category.
5. Determine the sub-category with the highest growth in profit in 2023 compared to 2022.

--`SQLQuery123.sql`: sql files which you can download and execute all the queries.

--`SQL_Python.ipynb`: main notebook for all preprocessing tasks.

--`orders.csv`: Data file which we have downloaded it from kaggle. However, we are going to download the dataset with the help of kaggle API.

--`final_data.csv`: Final dataset that we are going to import into our sql server.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided significant insights into sales performance, regional trends, and growth patterns. These insights can be used to inform business decisions and strategies for improving sales and targeting high-performing products and regions.

## Future Work
Deep Dive Analysis: Perform more detailed analysis on specific product categories or regions.

Visualization: Create interactive dashboards to visualize the data and trends.

Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning models to predict future sales trends.
